The data for this project can be downloaded from here      
[Project Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
 
The R script `run_analysis.R` can be used to generate a second dataset `MeansBySubjectAndActivity.txt`
by performing the following steps:

The R script ...      
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.    
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.     
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.     
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The final data set is called `MeansBySubjectAndActivity.txt`.

To run the script within RStudio, put it into your working directory. Go to the Console and
load the script using `source("run_analysis.R")` and execute the function `run_analysis()`.

This will generate the tidy data set `MeansBySubjectAndActivity.txt`.
It is not necessary to download the project data seperately, this is done within the script.


The `CodeBook.md` contains a description of the data set generated by the script.
